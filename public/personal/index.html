            This project emulates a BASH terminal session on a remote server. This project has a client server architecture, including networking sockets, a thread pool dealing with integers, and UNIX timers to handle malicious clients. All I/O operations are handled by an epoll loop, which waits for commands from the client, then relays the client's commands to a pseudo-terminal on the server. Once the commands are run on the server, the output is relayed back to the client.

            This project is provides a simple web browser, which sends all its URL requests via java socket to be handled by a remote server which returns raw HTML to the broswer. This functions similarly to a VPN by routing all URL to a remote server. The HTML returned to the client is displayed inside a WebView object from the JavaFX library.
